# Customer-segmentation-with-PCA-and-Kmeans
customer segmentation project that performs clustering with PCA technique, Kmeans, and hirerical clustering

This project aims to understand the type of customers the insurance has in order to create an effective marketing strategy that increases profitability through their premium sales and reduce churn.

In the notebook you will find:
EDA: exploratory data analysis
data quality assessment (Accuracy, Consistency, Completeness, Interprebility, Timelessness, Validity)
Data preparation: removing outliers, dealing with missing values, treating incorrect data, feature engineering, correlation analysis
Dimensionality reduction: through the Principal Component Analysis - PCA. 
Modeling: Choosing number of components based on PCA variance. Using elbow and silhoutte methods to find optimal number of K clusters. implement Kmeans model to determine     number of clusters and their characteristics
Evaluation: assessing the model using cardinality vs magnitude and inspect anomalies from coorelation
Repeat the modeling and evaluation part for the Hierarchical clustering to compare results from both models (cross-validation)


Final results
